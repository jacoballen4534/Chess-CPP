## My own chess engine in C++
This chess engine runs in the terminal and takes move inputs in the form:<br/>
[letter_colum_from, number_row_from], [letter_colum_to, number_row_to]

This project has been developed and tested in a unix environment.

# Instructions
The project has been setup with CMake, however, any make tool 'should' work.
There is a make file included.
`make all`
should build and start a new game.

# In the works
There are still two moves to be added, this is pawn promotion and En passant.

I am currently working on adding a bot to play against.
